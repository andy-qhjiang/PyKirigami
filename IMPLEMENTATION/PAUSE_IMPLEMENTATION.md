# Pause Functionality Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. SimulationController class (in event_handler.py):
- Added `is_paused` flag to track pause state
- Added `saved_velocities` dictionary to store velocities when paused
- Added `toggle_pause()` method that:
  - When pausing: saves current velocities, sets all velocities to zero, increases damping to maximum
  - When resuming: restores original damping values, clears saved velocities
  - Provides console feedback about pause/resume state

### 2. EventHandler class (in event_handler.py):
- Added `toggle_pause()` method that delegates to SimulationController
- Modified `step_simulation()` method to respect pause state:
  - When paused: only calls `p.stepSimulation()` to maintain GUI responsiveness
  - When not paused: applies forces and steps simulation normally

### 3. Main simulation loop (in run_sim.py):
- Added 'P' key handler to toggle pause/resume
- Updated help text to show the new pause control
- Added keyboard event processing for 'p' key

## How to use:
1. Run your simulation as normal: `python run_sim.py --vertices_file ... --constraints_file ...`
2. Press 'P' to pause the simulation (all objects freeze in place)
3. Press 'P' again to resume the simulation
4. The simulation will print status messages when pausing/resuming

## Benefits:
- Clean pause/resume without losing simulation state
- No external dependencies required
- Maintains GUI responsiveness even when paused
- Easy to take manual screenshots when paused
- Integrates seamlessly with existing codebase

The implementation is simple, robust, and focuses solely on the pause functionality without the complexity of snapshot creation.
